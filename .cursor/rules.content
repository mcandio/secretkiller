## Player Instructions (English)

Title:
THE SECRET ASSASSIN GAME (Chaotic but Chill)

Objective:
Each player has a secret mission.
Your goal is to eliminate your assigned target by naturally persuading them to enter a specific room while holding a specific object.

What You Receive:
You will secretly receive:
- One target (another guest)
- One room
- One object

This information is private. Do not show it to anyone.

How to Eliminate Someone:
If your target:
- Enters the assigned room
- While holding the assigned object

You may clearly say:
"You're dead."

At that moment, the elimination is valid.

What Happens When You’re Eliminated:
- You are out of the game.
- You must stop trying to manipulate other players.
- You may not reveal who killed you or what your mission was.
- The player who eliminated you inherits your mission and continues playing.

End of the Game:
The game ends when:
- Only one player remains alive, or
- The host decides to end the game.

Rules:
- No physical force.
- Do not say "this is for the game".
- Do not threaten or pressure anyone.
- Do not show messages, screens, or notes.
- Everything must feel casual and natural.

Final Warning:
Trust no one.
If someone asks you to grab something or go somewhere, be suspicious.
